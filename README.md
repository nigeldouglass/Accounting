## About

Accounting is a cross platform software solution developed in JavaScript with the use of NodeJS, ElectronJS and VUE for routing. It uses Node Addon API (N-API) as the backbone to do all the calculations and database handling.

The project was created to provide an accounting solution for both Mac and Windows platforms, as other solutions are either for one system only or donâ€™t have full functionality that many users require.

## The Plan

The plan to create a multi-platform software solution for people to use to help their businesses, with the prime focus being on an easy to use accounting solution.
